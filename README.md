## Description
A GPS Android App where I learned how to use FusedLocationProviderClient, Google Play services, Location Provider, and other parts of a GPS-aware application. I uploaded the following link on my youtube channel to show case the project features: https://youtu.be/6JiyUWSmD1g

## To download this application do the following steps:

1. Download Android Studio
2. Clone the repository from my github
3. Open the project in android studio
4. Connect your phone to your computer using a USB cable
5. Make sure your android phone has the correct API version with this project and the application will ask for your permissions
6. Run the project and it will be installed on your phone!
7. If you can't run the application or you don't have an android phone use the android studio's virtual phone
